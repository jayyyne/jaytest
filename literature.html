Ted Chiang-Stories of your life<br>
I've read some <u>captivating</u> short stories by the sci-fi novelist Ted Chiang. Beyond the<u> engaging (attractive/gripping/engrossing)</u> plots, what I truly appreciate is the philosophical depth embedded in his stories. Take, for instance, 'Stories of Your Life,' one of his most famous works. It explores the intriguing question of whether, given the chance to know the future, we would still choose to live our lives even if we foresee challenges. This has <font color="#c00000">sparked my contemplation</font> 沉思on the meaning of existence and what we should <font color="#c00000">strive for</font> (pursue) (grind for) in our lives."

As the Chinese saying goes, <u>history is like a little girl who allows anyone to dress her up</u>. There are numerous perspectives on history from different nations, making it challenging to <font color="#c00000">discern</font> the absolute truth. People with shared knowledge and beliefs are more likely to connect, which often serves political purposes. Nevertheless, it's essential to reflect on what we know, explore materials from various perspectives, and <font color="#c00000">strive to</font> contribute to <font color="#c00000">a more nuanced understanding</font> that edges closer to the truth.

余华-活着

One of the books that I have read numerous times is titled "To Live," written by the Chinese novelist Yu Hua and published in 1993. I would say it is my favorite fiction work.

The narrative revolves around the lives of the main character, Fugui, and his family, set against the backdrop of the Chinese Revolution that spanned from 1966 to 1976. This historical period was marked by challenging economic conditions and a <font color="#c00000">turbulent</font> political environment, making it a tough era for the Chinese people.

The story begins with Fugui's drastic transformation from a landlord's son to an ordinary person overnight due to overwhelming debt. As life becomes increasingly difficult, his family members leave him one by one. His parents <font color="#c00000">succumb to</font> illness, his son dies from excessive blood loss during a blood donation process, and his daughter passes away due to childbirth complications shortly after getting married. Overwhelmed with grief, his wife also dies. After several years of living with his son-in-law and grandson, they too leave him, leaving Fugui alone in the world.

It's a <font color="#c00000">tragic</font> <font color="#c00000">tale</font> (sad story), with misfortunes seemingly piling up on Fugui—from losing his parents in his youth to the deaths of his son, daughter, and wife in middle age, and finally losing another son and grandson in his old age. However, it <font color="#c00000">reflects the harsh realities of life</font>, where numerous challenges and tough times are inevitable. Every time I revisit the book, it serves as a reminder to cherish the present moment. This is the reason why I hold the book in high regard and <font color="#c00000">revisit its pages</font> time and time again.
